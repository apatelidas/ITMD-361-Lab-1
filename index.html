<h2>My first lab in ITMD 361</h2>
  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hi! My name is Anthi Lagunas and this is one of my first classes at IIT</p>
  <p>I am just starting out in this program and am excited to learn more. I have 3 dogs and a cat and love to spend time with them.</p>
  <p>When I can I like to make jewelry, focusing on fabrication, wax casting, learning CAD, and stone setting. Jewelry is my main passion and I love to learn new techniques.</p>
